# Unreal Engine 3 Aircraft Mod

This is an aircraft physics mod for UE3 based on https://github.com/gasgiant/Aircraft-Physics.
The original Unity project is written in C#. This is a re-implementation of it in UnrealScript
for Unreal Engine 3. There are a lot of workarounds that are put in place in an attempt to make
the project work, but it still has a lot of work to do to make it actually playable.

I started this project originally in 2021 and have archived it recently in GitHub in hopes
of finalizing the implementation and getting it to work on a satisfactory level finally.

# Issues / TODO

There are currently some issues with the physics, mainly instability and being able to take off.
These are due to different approaches to handling physics in Unity vs. UE3 among other things.
