# Unreal Engine 3 Aircraft Mod

This is an aircraft physics mod for UE3 based on https://github.com/gasgiant/Aircraft-Physics.
The original project is written in C# for unity. This is a re-implementation of it in UnrealScript
for Unreal Engine 3. There are a lot of workarounds that are put in place in an attempt to make
the project work, but it still has a lot of work to do to make it actually playable.

# Issues

There are currently some issues with the physics, mainly instability and being able to take off.
These are due to different approaches to handling physics in Unity vs. UE3 among other things.
